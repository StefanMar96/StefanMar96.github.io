									<h1>Making a website<br /></h1>
									<p>The purpose of this project was to design a functional website that will contain my resume, as well as all the projects that i complete in the course Manufacturing Processes (VÉL403G) at the University of Iceland.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/webdesign.jpg" alt="" /></div>
                                <h3>The beginning</h3>
                                <p>The first thing that I needed to do was to educate myself on the basics in Html programming. I decided to view the material that the professor of the course had uploaded to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU4NWxEpJJumoJghcC5V3rjv0_VHE7IQr">Youtube</a>, as well as the website <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">w3schools</a>. All of the information I gathered proved to be extremely helpful as the project became much clearer the more I learned about the Html language.</p>
								<p>Since I had no previous experience with HTML, I decided to use a template from <a href="https://html5up.net">HTML5UP</a> to use as a starting point. The template that I started with is called "Massively", and I picked that template because of its looks.</p>
                                <div class="image main"><img src="images/massively.PNG" alt="" /></div>
                                <h3>Programs</h3>
                                <h4>Brackets</h4>
                                <p>For this project, I downloaded <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a> to edit the HTML code which I got from HTML5UP. The reason for why I chose to use Brackets is because you can click on the lightning in the top-right corner to see any changes you make in the code as soon as you save the changes, which is a great feature.</p>
                                <div class="image main"><img src="images/brackets.PNG" alt="" /></div>
                                <h4>Github</h4>
                                <p>I already had a <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> account, so I just needed to create a repository to host the files which make up the website. I also used Github to host my website duo to the fact that it is extremely easy to do it from there.</p>
                                <p>I chose a convenient name for my repository, which is the same as the link I want people to be able to access my website through.</p>
                                <div class="image main"><img src="images/repository.PNG" alt="" /></div>
                                <h4>Git</h4>
                                <p>Lastly, I had to download the program <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git</a>, which is used to track changes in a source code during software development. I mainly used Git to push the changes I made in the source code to my repository on Github.</p>
                                <p>I went to the folder where all the files for my website were, and I pressed the right click buttun on the mouse and then pressed "Git bash here"</p>
                                <div class="image main"><img src="images/gitbash.png" alt="" /></div>
                                <p>Then i typed the following into the terminal:</p>
                                <p>1. echo "# StefanMar96.github.io" >> README.md</p>
                                <p>2. git init</p>
                                <p>3. git add README.md</p>
                                <p>4. git commin -m "first commit"</p>
                                <p>5. git branch -M main</p>
                                <p>6. git remote add origin https://github.com/StefanMar96/StefanMar96.github.io.git</p>
                                <p>7. git push -u origin main</p>
                                <p>8. git add .</p>
                                <p>9. git commit -m "first commit" .</p>
                                <p>10. git push</p>
                                <p>Now the files will have been pushed to my repository and it should look like this.</p>
                                <div class="image main"><img src="images/repo.png" alt="" /></div>
                                <p>Now the only thing left to do is, click on settings on the repository, scroll down to GitHub Pages and click on source and change it to Main. Then I can see the url which can be used to access the website. </p>
                                <div class="image main"><img src="images/publish.png" alt="" /></div>
