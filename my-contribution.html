									<h1>Final project - my contribution<br /></h1>
									<p>A part of the final project is to document my contribution to the project.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/matrix.jpg" height="70%" width="70%" alt="" />

                                <p>We divided the team roles when we started to discuss the project.</p>
                                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/roles.png" height="70%" width="70%" alt="" />
                                <p>As you can see, I took on the role of the programmer and was responsible for documenting all the process of the projesc on a team website that I created. I decided to host the teams website under my own website for simplicity, if you however click on the teams website, you can not click on anything to return to my website.</p>
                                <p>You enter the teams website by clicking on "Team website".</p>
                                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/teamwebsitehere.PNG" height="50%" width="50%" alt="" />
                                
                                <p>I could use a lot of knowledge that I had previously aquired to make the website. I still used the same template from <a href="https://html5up.net">HTML5UP</a> as I used on my own website. That template is called "Massively"</p>
                                
                                <p>I still used <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a> to edit the HTML code which I got from HTML5UP like I did for my own website.</p>
                                
                                <p>One thing thet I did differently now as opposed to when I made my own website was that I did not use "Git" to upload the HTML files to my github. Instead I decided to use the app called <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">Github desktop</a>. </p>
                                
                                <p>Github desktop makes the process of uploading the HTML code to my github much simpler. I just have to connect the program to the folder in my computer where the files are stored.</p>
                                <p>After I make any changes, such as changing the code or add new photos to the folder, I can see the changes in the app. Then I just have to make an explenation for the changes and click on "commit to main".</p>
                                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/desktop_app.PNG" height="70%" width="70%" alt="" />
                                    
                                <p>After that, I just have to click on "Push to orgin" and the files should now be on my github.</p>
                                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/push-orgin.PNG" height="70%" width="70%" alt="" />
                                    
                                <p>A tricky part og the project was to upload videos and a powerpoint presentation to the website. For the video, I went on  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_video.asp">this website</a> and saw the following coce that I used as a template.</p>
                                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/add_video.PNG" height="40%" width="40%" alt="" />
                                <p>For the slideshow presentation, I used <a href="https://convertio.co/ppt-html/">this website</a> to transform the powerpoint file into a HTML file that I linked on the teams website.</p>
                                
                                
                                <p>I worked closely with both Hrannar and Magnús, and I was constantly taking screen captures to use on the website so it would not be forgotten how we designed the project</p>
                                
                                <br>
                                
                                <p>I also created the licence and product description for our project:<br>1. For the licence, I found a standard MIT Licence on <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">this website</a> that I used as a template.<br>2. For the product description, I looked at the websites from previous students to get an idea of how it should look like. After a while, I got a good idea on how it should look like and designed the product description in Microsoft Word.</p>
