									<h1>Molding and casting<br /></h1>
									<p>This project was the second part of 3 in the final project of course Manufacturing processes (VÃ‰L403G). In this part, we had to design a mold that we will use to create an object made from wax or foam plastic. Due to the fact that we are in a global pandemic, we just have to design the mold and simulate the molding preocess but not actually create the object.</p>

                                <h3>The beginning</h3>
                                <p>The first thing that we had to do was to come up with an object to make. That was very simple, since we made "The maze" as project 4 we wanted to make a ball that is used in the maze.</p>
                                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/balls.jpg" height="40%" width="40%" alt="" />
                                <p>Since we had all used <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/campaigns/education/fusion-360">Fusion360</a> before in previous projects, we decided to make the object in the program Fusion360.</p>
                                
                                <h3>Fusion 360</h3>
                                <p>We started of by making a sphere with the size that we felt was appropriate for our maze.</p>
                                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/sphere.png" height="40%" width="40%" alt="" />
                                <p>After that, we created a sketch in the middle of the sphere that will be used tater.</p>
                                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/sphere_plane.png" height="40%" width="40%" alt="" />
                                <p>Next, we extruded the sketch in both directions so that it would make a rectangle that completely covered the sphere.</p>
                                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/sphere_cube.png" height="40%" width="40%" alt="" />
                                <p>After that, we used the "combine feature" to make the box hollow where th sphere should be.</p>
                                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/sphere_combine.png" height="40%" width="40%" alt="" />
                                <p>Next, we created a plane through the missle of the box.</p>
                                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/box_plane.png" height="40%" width="40%" alt="" />
                                <p>After that, we used the plane th split the box into two boxes.</p>
                                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/box_split.png" height="40%" width="40%" alt="" />
                                <p>Next, we added support to the lower box that will help in the molding process.</p>
                                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/mold_support.png" height="60%" width="60%" alt="" />
                                <p>After that, we used the "combine feature" to make the box hollow where th support should be.</p>
                                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/support_hollow.png" height="60%" width="60%" alt="" />
                                <p>Next, we had to make a cyllinder hole that would be used to insert the material into the mold.</p>
                                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/inject.png" height="60%" width="60%" alt="" />
                                <p>The next thing that we did, was to align the top and bottom part of the box side by side.</p>
                                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/sidebyside.png" height="70%" width="70%" alt="" />
                                <p>Atfer that, we moved one side further away from the other box to have some space in between.</p>
                                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/move_box.png" height="70%" width="70%" alt="" />
                                <p>After that, we mada an even bigger box that contains both of the previous boxes.</p>
                                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/big_box.png" height="70%" width="70%" alt="" />
                                <p>Next, we combined the 3 boxes in to 1 box.</p>
                                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/combine_bigbox.png" height="70%" width="70%" alt="" />
                                <p>After thet, we were left with the following mold.</p>
                                <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/mold.png" height="70%" width="70%" alt="" />
                                    
                                <p>Then we simulated the molding and casting process and here are the following results.</p>
                                
                                <center>
                                <iframe width="560px" height="320px" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://haskoliislands.instructuremedia.com/embed/552bf87a-69a4-4618-b83d-ced505816b3c" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                                </center>    
                                
                                <p>If there was no pandemic, we would now go to fableb and make this mold and then fill it with silicone and after that close tha 2 boxes togeather. After that, we would inject wax into the mold and wait. After a while, we would remowe the silicone and then we would have a nice ball on the inside that we would use with our Maze. </p>
